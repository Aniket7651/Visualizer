        "introduction": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in the United States, with well-established infrastructure for early detection, diagnosis, treatment, and research. Mammography screening is widely available, with organized programs and national guidelines promoting early detection. Advanced molecular testing, including HER2, ER, PR, and BRCA1/2, is routinely performed, supporting precision medicine approaches. Clinical guidelines, such as NCCN and ESMO adaptations, are widely implemented across institutions. Public awareness campaigns are extensive, and survival rates are high due to early detection and access to advanced therapies. Reimbursement coverage is strong, and many treatments are available at no or low cost through insurance programs. The U.S. demonstrates advanced maturity in breast cancer care, although disparities exist in rural and underserved populations.",
