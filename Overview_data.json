        "introduction": "Prostate cancer incidence is steadily rising in China, reflecting increased life expectancy, westernized lifestyles, and improved detection rates. Specialized cancer centers are well-established in major metropolitan areas, but access in rural and less developed regions remains constrained. Molecular diagnostic infrastructure is relatively stronger compared to many LMICs, though advanced biomarker testing (TMPRSS2-ERG, PTEN, BRCA1/2) is still underutilized and concentrated in higher-tier hospitals. Standard treatment options are broadly available, and national clinical guidelines exist, with moderate implementation and partial alignment to international standards. However, reimbursement and no-cost access remain limited, leading to high out-of-pocket expenditures. Opportunistic PSA testing and some regional screening initiatives exist, but no nationwide organized screening program is in place. Overall, China demonstrates a moderate maturity level (3) in prostate cancer care, with strong foundations in infrastructure and treatment but persistent inequities in biomarker access, screening, and financial protection.",

        "introduction": "Prostate cancer is an increasingly recognized health burden in Ethiopia, yet the system for detection, treatment, and equitable access remains at an early stage. Specialized cancer care is concentrated in a handful of tertiary hospitals (notably Addis Ababa), leaving most of the country without access to oncology or urology services. Genetic and molecular testing infrastructure is almost absent, and biomarker utilization beyond PSA is minimal. Treatment options are limited by geography, cost, and capacity constraints, with radiotherapy and surgery accessible only in a few facilities. Research activity is extremely modest, and awareness campaigns remain scarce, leading to late-stage presentation in the majority of patients. Clinical guidelines are not well implemented, and alignment with international standards is minimal. Reimbursement and no-cost access are weak, resulting in high out-of-pocket costs. No national screening program exists; prostate cancer detection relies almost entirely on opportunistic PSA testing in urban hospitals. Overall, Ethiopia demonstrates a low maturity level (2) in prostate cancer care, with nascent foundations but wide gaps across the continuum.",
