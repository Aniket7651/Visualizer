Specialized oncology services are concentrated in urban centers, leaving rural populations underserved. Molecular testing for biomarkers is available but restricted to a few hospitals. Survival outcomes remain poor due to late-stage detection, with no national LDCT screening program in place. Palliative care is weak, and awareness campaigns are limited in scope. Clinical guidelines exist but lack consistent adoption, and reimbursement remains underdeveloped, creating inequities in access to therapies. Overall, Algeria’s maturity level for lung cancer care is 2, reflecting foundational structures but major gaps in equity, screening, and advanced care.",
