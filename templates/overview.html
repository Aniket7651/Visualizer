            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Breast cancer is a major health challenge in Russia, where progress has been made in infrastructure and
                treatment access. The country benefits from specialized cancer centers and growing molecular testing
                capacity, though regional disparities remain. Treatment access is supported by public funding and
                guidelines, yet awareness and early detection lag. Survival rates are comparatively good, but palliative
                care services are less developed. Biomarker testing is strong for HER2, ER, and PR, while BRCA1/2
                coverage is more limited. Clinical guidelines, including ESMO standards, are well implemented, though
                updates are not consistently adopted. Reimbursement provides partial coverage, with limited no-cost
                access creating inequities. Screening programs exist but struggle to achieve wide, systematic coverage.
                Overall, Russia demonstrates strong foundations but requires targeted efforts to improve equity, early
                detection, and advanced diagnostics.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Geographic and socioeconomic disparities may widen without targeted interventions.</li>
                    <li>Economic constraints and healthcare budget pressures could limit innovation uptake.</li>
                    <li>Possible shortages of oncology workforce in rural regions.</li>
                    <li>Risk of slower adoption of updated international guidelines, leading to delays in best practice
                        implementation.</li>
                    <li>Patient distrust or low participation in screening programs may persist.</li>
                    <li>Rising incidence rates of breast cancer could strain existing healthcare infrastructure.</li>
