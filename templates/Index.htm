        <h1>Breast Cancer Facts: Insights & Key Developments</h1>
        <p>This factsheet provides a comprehensive overview of key pillars shaping breast cancer care, including
            specialized infrastructure, treatment accessibility, research funding, early detection, and palliative
            care.</p>

                        <p>Centers like INCan and Hospital General de Mexico provide high-quality care in major
                            cities. HER2, ER, and PR testing are available in tertiary hospitals and integrated into
                            standard care.</p>
                        <h3>Opportunities</h3>
                        <p>Expand regional cancer centers and public investment in pathology. Improve access to BRCA

                            with limited oncology capacity. Pathology and genetic testing infrastructure is
                            underdeveloped in the public sector.</p>

                        <p>Rural and low-income patients are at risk of delayed diagnosis and undertreatment due to

                        <p>National guidelines offer free biennial mammograms for women aged 40-69. Public sector
                            operates over 1,200 mammography units.</p>
                        <h3>Opportunities</h3>
                        <p>Transition to organized, invitation-based screening models. Focus outreach on underserved

                            states. Long wait times, stigma, and poor follow-up systems reduce program impact.</p>
                        <h3>Threats</h3>
                        <p>Continued low uptake will sustain high rates of late-stage diagnosis and mortality.</p>
