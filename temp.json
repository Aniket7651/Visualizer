        "introduction": "Russia has a moderately advanced breast cancer care system. National screening programs provide biennial mammograms for women aged 50–69. Specialized oncology centers across major cities offer comprehensive diagnostics, molecular testing (HER2, ER, PR, BRCA1/2), surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Clinical guidelines are aligned with international standards and widely implemented in urban centers. Awareness campaigns are ongoing, contributing to early detection, though rural areas have limited coverage. Palliative care services are moderately developed, and research funding supports local studies and international collaborations. Survival rates are improving, though regional disparities remain.",
