        "introduction": "Poland has a developing breast cancer care system with organized screening programs and improving access to diagnostics and treatment. Biennial mammography is available for women aged 50â€“69, though participation varies regionally. Specialized cancer centers exist mainly in urban areas, and molecular testing (HER2, ER, PR, BRCA1/2) is increasingly available but limited outside major cities. Clinical guidelines are aligned with international standards but implementation is inconsistent. Research funding is moderate, with some local studies and limited international trial participation. Public awareness campaigns are present, but screening uptake is lower compared to Western European countries. Palliative care services exist but are less developed in rural areas.",
