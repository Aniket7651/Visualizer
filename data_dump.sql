3	prostate	China	CN	Prostate cancer incidence is steadily rising in China, reflecting increased life expectancy, westernized lifestyles, and improved detection rates. Specialized cancer centers are well-established in major metropolitan areas, but access in rural and less developed regions remains constrained. Molecular diagnostic infrastructure is relatively stronger compared to many LMICs, though advanced biomarker testing (TMPRSS2-ERG, PTEN, BRCA1/2) is still underutilized and concentrated in higher-tier hospitals. Standard treatment options are broadly available, and national clinical guidelines exist, with moderate implementation and partial alignment to international standards. However, reimbursement and no-cost access remain limited, leading to high out-of-pocket expenditures. Opportunistic PSA testing and some regional screening initiatives exist, but no nationwide organized screening program is in place. Overall, China demonstrates a moderate maturity level (3) in prostate cancer care, with strong foundations in infrastructure and treatment but persistent inequities in biomarker access, screening, and financial protection.	{"Threats": ["Rising prostate cancer burden risks overwhelming health systems.", "Financial barriers may worsen inequities between rich and poor regions.", "Slow adoption of international guideline updates may limit optimal care.", "Workforce shortages in oncology and urology persist outside urban centers."], "Strengths": ["Established specialized cancer centers across urban regions.", "Relatively stronger infrastructure for genetic and molecular testing compared to many LMICs.", "Standard treatments (surgery, radiotherapy, androgen deprivation therapy) widely available in tertiary centers.", "Active cancer research environment with growing local evidence base.", "Awareness efforts improving, especially in metropolitan areas."], "Weaknesses": ["Significant urban–rural disparities in access to diagnosis and treatment.", "Advanced biomarkers (TMPRSS2-ERG, PTEN, BRCA1/2) rarely used in clinical practice.", "Opportunistic screening only; no national organized program.", "Out-of-pocket burden remains high due to weak reimbursement.", "Palliative care is underdeveloped, particularly in rural regions"], "Opportunities": ["Expand molecular diagnostic testing beyond top-tier hospitals.", "Develop structured early detection pilots for high-risk populations.", "Strengthen national reimbursement schemes to reduce inequities.", "Leverage digital health and telemedicine to bridge urban–rural gaps.", "Enhance participation in global clinical trials to accelerate innovation."]}	{"PSA": {"disc": "Widely available but not systematically applied.", "score": "~30%"}, "PTEN": {"disc": "Rarely accessible outside top centers.", "score": "~10%"}, "BRCA1": {"disc": "Very limited testing capacity.", "score": "~5%"}, "BRCA2": {"disc": "Very limited testing capacity.", "score": "~5%"}, "TMPRSS2_ERG": {"disc": "Limited use, mainly in research settings", "score": "~15%"}}	{"National_Screening": {"disc": "Opportunistic PSA testing; some regional programs, no national rollout.", "score": "--"}}	{"Feasibility": {"disc": "Feasible in urban centers; weaker in rural hospitals.", "score": "3/5"}, "Implementation": {"disc": "Moderate implementation in tertiary hospitals.", "score": "3/5"}, "ESMO_Guidelines": {"disc": "Integrated to some extent, but not consistently applied.", "score": "2/5"}, "Engagement_with_Updates": {"disc": "Larger hospitals keep pace; smaller ones lag", "score": "2/3"}, "Adoption_International_Guideline": {"disc": "Partial alignment with NCCN/ESMO; adaptation ongoing.", "score": "3/5"}}	{"Specialized_Centers": {"disc": "Established in major urban hubs; weaker in rural/remote regions.", "score": "3/5"}, "Genetic_Molecular_Testing": {"disc": "Stronger infrastructure than many LMICs; access uneven.", "score": "4/5"}}	{"No-cost_Access": {"disc": "Minimal subsidies available; inequities persist.", "score": "2/5"}, "Reimbursement_Coverage": {"disc": "Limited coverage for advanced therapies; high out-of-pocket costs.", "score": "2/5"}}	{"Survival_Rates": {"disc": "Outcomes improving but still below high-income countries.", "score": "3/5"}, "Early_Detection": {"disc": "Opportunistic PSA testing; some regional pilots, no national program.", "score": "3/5"}, "Palliative_Care": {"disc": "Services exist but underdeveloped; rural coverage weak.", "score": "3/5"}}	{"Research_Funding": {"disc": "Active research programs; moderate funding support.", "score": "3/5"}, "Treatment_Access": {"disc": "Broadly available in tertiary hospitals; inequities by geography.", "score": "3/5"}, "Awareness_Campaigns": {"disc": "Growing campaigns in urban areas; rural reach remains limited.", "score": "3/5"}}
4	prostate	France	FR	Prostate cancer is a major health concern among men in France, but the country has well-established infrastructure and relatively high standards of care. Specialized cancer centers are widely available, advanced diagnostics and molecular testing are integrated into clinical practice, and clinical guidelines are consistently implemented across institutions. Screening is primarily opportunistic, and while reimbursement coverage exists, some out-of-pocket costs remain. Overall, prostate cancer care in France demonstrates high maturity (level 4), with strong infrastructure and clinical integration, though there is room for improving national screening programs and equitable access in all regions.	{"Threats": ["Rising prostate cancer incidence may challenge healthcare resources.", "Workforce shortages in urology and oncology may impact rural service delivery.", "Disparities in access between metropolitan and rural areas could persist without policy interventions."], "Strengths": ["Comprehensive network of specialized cancer centers covering most regions.", "Broad access to standard treatments (surgery, radiotherapy, androgen deprivation therapy).", "Advanced molecular diagnostics widely available (TMPRSS2-ERG, PTEN, BRCA1/2).", "High research activity and clinical trial participation.", "National clinical guidelines consistently implemented and aligned with ESMO/NCCN standards."], "Weaknesses": ["Screening is mostly opportunistic, with no formal population-based national program.", "Some minor inequities in access to advanced therapies and molecular testing in rural areas.", "Reimbursement coverage is good but not always comprehensive for all advanced therapies."], "Opportunities": ["Implement organized national screening for high-risk populations.", "Expand public awareness campaigns to further improve early detection.", "Increase access to palliative care in underserved regions.", "Integrate new biomarker-based targeted therapies into routine practice."]}	{"PSA": {"disc": "Widely used in clinical practice.", "score": "80%"}, "PTEN": {"disc": "Routine in tertiary centers for advanced/metastatic cases.", "score": "40%"}, "BRCA1": {"disc": "Available for targeted therapy and clinical trials.", "score": "30%"}, "BRCA2": {"disc": "Similar to BRCA1; supports precision medicine decisions", "score": "35%"}, "TMPRSS2_ERG": {"disc": "Integrated in selected centers for risk stratification.", "score": "45%"}}	{"National_Screening": {"disc": "No organized population-based program; mostly opportunistic screenin", "score": "Opportunistic PSA testing"}}	{"Feasibility": {"disc": "Easily integrated into clinical workflow.", "score": "5/5"}, "Implementation": {"disc": "Guidelines fully implemented across most hospitals.", "score": "5/5"}, "ESMO_Guidelines": {"disc": "Comprehensive integration for localized and advanced disease.", "score": "5/5"}, "Engagement_with_Updates": {"disc": "National centers regularly update protocols.", "score": "3/3"}, "Adoption_International_Guideline": {"disc": "Full alignment with ESMO/NCCN standards.", "score": "5/5"}}	{"Specialized_Centers": {"disc": "Extensive network across France; rural areas mostly covered.", "score": "5/5"}, "Genetic_Molecular_Testing": {"disc": "Advanced biomarkers (TMPRSS2-ERG, PTEN, BRCA1/2) routinely available.", "score": "5/5"}}	{"No-cost_Access": {"disc": "Limited gaps; certain advanced therapies require co-payment.", "score": "3/5"}, "Reimbursement_Coverage": {"disc": "Public insurance covers most treatments; some out-of-pocket costs persist.", "score": "3/5"}}	{"Survival_Rates": {"disc": "High survival due to early detection and standard-of-care treatment.", "score": "5/5"}, "Early_Detection": {"disc": "Opportunistic PSA testing common; no organized national program.", "score": "4/5"}, "Palliative_Care": {"disc": "Good coverage; some gaps in rural service integration.", "score": "4/5"}}	{"Research_Funding": {"disc": "Strong local and international clinical research participation.", "score": "4/5"}, "Treatment_Access": {"disc": "Standard therapies widely available; minor rural gaps.", "score": "4/5"}, "Awareness_Campaigns": {"disc": "Effective campaigns, but scope to increase outreach in underserved areas", "score": "4/5"}}
5	prostate	Algeria	DZ	Prostate cancer is a growing public health concern in Algeria, yet structured early detection and equitable service distribution remain limited. Specialized cancer centers exist but are unevenly distributed, with stronger access in urban areas compared to rural regions. Advanced diagnostics and biomarker testing (PSA, TMPRSS2-ERG, PTEN, BRCA1/2) are available only in a limited capacity, primarily in tertiary or private facilities. National clinical guidelines exist but implementation and integration are inconsistent, and alignment with international standards (such as ESMO) is weak. Treatment access is moderately available, but inequities persist due to geographic, financial, and infrastructural barriers. Palliative care services are constrained, and awareness efforts remain insufficient. Screening is not systematic, with opportunistic PSA testing and limited awareness campaigns forming the mainstay of early detection. Overall, Algeria demonstrates a moderate maturity level (3), reflecting a health system with established foundations but persistent challenges in screening, biomarker integration, and equitable care delivery.	{"Threats": ["Rising incidence of prostate cancer without structured screening may worsen late-stage diagnoses.", "Limited reimbursement and subsidy mechanisms contribute to high out-of-pocket burden.", "Inequities between private and public sector care could deepen.", "Workforce and budgetary constraints may slow expansion of advanced diagnostics."], "Strengths": ["Specialized cancer centers established in urban regions.", "PSA testing is available, though not systematically applied.", "National clinical guidelines present, with partial adoption in higher-level hospitals.", "Basic treatment options (surgery, radiotherapy, hormone therapy) available in public sector.", "Some local research activity contributing to regional understanding."], "Weaknesses": ["Geographic disparities; rural areas lack access to advanced services.", "Biomarker utilization (TMPRSS2-ERG, PTEN, BRCA1/2) is very low.", "No national screening program; opportunistic testing dominates.", "Palliative care coverage is limited, with opioid access barriers.", "Low public awareness and stigma affect early health-seeking behavior.", "Implementation of guidelines inconsistent across facilities."], "Opportunities": ["Expand molecular diagnostic infrastructure beyond urban hubs.", "Strengthen awareness campaigns and community engagement to improve early detection.", "Enhance palliative care through workforce training and opioid access reform.", "Leverage telemedicine to support oncology services in underserved areas.", "Increase participation in international research collaborations and clinical trials."]}	{"PSA": {"disc": "Most commonly used biomarker, but coverage inconsistent.", "score": "~45%"}, "PTEN": {"disc": "Very limited testing.", "score": "~10%"}, "BRCA1": {"disc": "Rarely available.", "score": "~5%"}, "BRCA2": {"disc": "Rarely available.", "score": "~5%"}, "TMPRSS2_ERG": {"disc": "Rarely available, mostly in specialized facilities.", "score": "~15%"}}	{"National_Screening": {"disc": "No organized program; awareness efforts underway but limited.", "score": "None"}}	{"Feasibility": {"disc": "Feasible in higher-tier centers, limited in smaller hospitals.", "score": "2/5"}, "Implementation": {"disc": "Partial implementation, stronger in tertiary hospitals.", "score": "2/5"}, "ESMO_Guidelines": {"disc": "Minimal alignment.", "score": "1/5"}, "Engagement_with_Updates": {"disc": "Limited; smaller hospitals not consistently updated.", "score": "1/3"}, "Adoption_International_Guideline": {"disc": "Weak alignment with ESMO/NCCN.", "score": "2/5"}}	{"Specialized_Centers": {"disc": "Present in major cities but unevenly distributed; rural access weak.", "score": "2/5"}, "Genetic_Molecular_Testing": {"disc": "Limited availability; advanced biomarkers rarely accessible.", "score": "2/5"}}	{"No-cost_Access": {"disc": "Some subsidies exist, but patchy and insufficient.", "score": "2/5"}, "Reimbursement_Coverage": {"disc": "Limited insurance coverage; patients often face high OOP costs.", "score": "2/5"}}	{"Survival_Rates": {"disc": "Outcomes compromised by late diagnosis and treatment delays.", "score": "2/5"}, "Early_Detection": {"disc": "Opportunistic PSA only; no structured program.", "score": "2/5"}, "Palliative_Care": {"disc": "Limited integration and opioid access challenges.", "score": "2/5"}}	{"Research_Funding": {"disc": "Some activity, but limited in scope and funding.", "score": "2/5"}, "Treatment_Access": {"disc": "Standard treatments available, but access varies by geography.", "score": "2/5"}, "Awareness_Campaigns": {"disc": "Low visibility; limited impact in rural areas.", "score": "2/5"}}
6	prostate	Argentina	AR	Prostate cancer is a significant health concern in Argentina. Specialized centers exist in urban regions, but rural access remains limited. Molecular biomarker testing is available mainly in tertiary or private facilities. Clinical guidelines are generally implemented in larger hospitals, with partial alignment to international standards. Screening is opportunistic via PSA testing, with no national program. Overall, prostate cancer care in Argentina shows moderate maturity, with gaps in equitable access, systematic screening, and biomarker utilization.	{"Threats": ["Rising prostate cancer incidence could strain existing healthcare infrastructure.", "Budget constraints may limit adoption of advanced therapies.", "Disparities between private and public sectors could worsen inequities.", "Workforce shortages in oncology and urology outside urban centers."], "Strengths": ["Presence of specialized cancer centers in major urban areas.", "Access to standard prostate cancer therapies (surgery, radiotherapy, androgen deprivation therapy) in tertiary hospitals.", "Clinical guidelines exist and are relatively well implemented in urban hospitals.", "Active research funding contributing to regional data."], "Weaknesses": ["Limited access to advanced diagnostics and molecular testing in rural areas.", "Biomarker utilization (TMPRSS2-ERG, PTEN, BRCA1/2) remains low.", "No population-level screening; PSA testing is opportunistic.", "Palliative care availability is moderate but may be limited in non-urban settings.", "Financial burden for advanced therapies can be high due to partial reimbursement."], "Opportunities": ["Expand access to molecular diagnostics and biomarker testing.", "Strengthen public health awareness campaigns and community outreach.", "Develop pilot programs for systematic early detection in high-risk populations.", "Integrate Argentine patients in international clinical trials.", "Improve equitable access to palliative care services."]}	{"PSA": {"disc": "Widely used but opportunistic", "score": "55%"}, "PTEN": {"disc": "Rarely used outside research", "score": "20%"}, "BRCA1": {"disc": "Very limited testing", "score": "15%"}, "BRCA2": {"disc": "Very limited testing", "score": "15%"}, "TMPRSS2_ERG": {"disc": "Limited access", "score": "25%"}}	{"National_Screening": {"disc": "No organized national screening; PSA testing common", "score": "Opportunistic PSA"}}	{"Feasibility": {"disc": "Feasible in urban hospitals", "score": "4/5"}, "Implementation": {"disc": "Guidelines followed in tertiary centers", "score": "4/5"}, "ESMO_Guidelines": {"disc": "Integrated for advanced/metastatic care", "score": "4/5"}, "Engagement_with_Updates": {"disc": "National centers update regularly; smaller hospitals lag", "score": "2/3"}, "Adoption_International_Guideline": {"disc": "Partial alignment with ESMO/NCCN", "score": "4/5"}}	{"Specialized_Centers": {"disc": "Urban centers well-equipped; rural access limited", "score": "3/5"}, "Genetic_Molecular_Testing": {"disc": "Advanced biomarkers mainly in tertiary/private facilities", "score": "3/5"}}	{"No-cost_Access": {"disc": "Limited free access; out-of-pocket costs persist", "score": "3/5"}, "Reimbursement_Coverage": {"disc": "Partial reimbursement; gaps remain for advanced therapies", "score": "3/5"}}	{"Survival_Rates": {"disc": "Comparable to regional standards; late-stage diagnoses persist", "score": "3/5"}, "Early_Detection": {"disc": "Opportunistic PSA testing only; no national program", "score": "3/5"}, "Palliative_Care": {"disc": "Available in urban centers; rural gaps persist", "score": "3/5"}}	{"Research_Funding": {"disc": "Ongoing funding supports regional studies", "score": "3/5"}, "Treatment_Access": {"disc": "Standard therapies available; inequities in rural areas", "score": "2/5"}, "Awareness_Campaigns": {"disc": "Moderate campaigns; awareness gaps remain", "score": "3/5"}}
7	prostate	Australia	AU	Australia has a well-developed prostate cancer care system with high coverage of specialized centers, structured early detection, and access to advanced diagnostics. Survival rates are high due to systematic PSA screening and timely intervention. Molecular biomarker testing is available but not fully universal. National guidelines are implemented comprehensively, and awareness campaigns are active. Reimbursement exists but some gaps persist for newer therapies.

8	prostate	Brazil	BR	Prostate cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers among men in Brazil. While specialized centers exist in major urban areas, rural regions face limited access to diagnostics and treatment. Molecular biomarker testing (TMPRSS2-ERG, PTEN, BRCA1/2) is available but not widespread.

12	prostate	Egypt	EG	Prostate cancer is a leading cancer among men in Egypt, yet early detection and equitable access to advanced care remain challenging. Specialized cancer centers exist but are concentrated in urban hubs, with rural regions underserved. Genetic and molecular testing infrastructure exists at a moderate level, though advanced biomarker utilization (beyond PSA) is limited. Standard treatments are available in tertiary hospitals, but access varies significantly across the health system. Research and awareness efforts are present but underfunded, with low public knowledge contributing to late-stage presentation. National clinical guidelines exist and are moderately well implemented, with partial alignment to international standards such as ESMO/NCCN. However, reimbursement coverage remains limited, leaving most patients to face significant out-of-pocket costs.

13	prostate	Ethiopia	ET	Prostate cancer is an increasingly recognized health burden in Ethiopia, yet the system for detection, treatment, and equitable access remains at an early stage. Specialized cancer care is concentrated in a handful of tertiary hospitals (notably Addis Ababa), leaving most of the country without access to oncology or urology services. Genetic and molecular testing infrastructure is almost absent, and biomarker utilization beyond PSA is minimal. Treatment options are limited by geography, cost, and capacity constraints, with radiotherapy and surgery accessible only in a few facilities. Research activity is extremely modest, and awareness campaigns remain scarce, leading to late-stage presentation in the majority of patients. Clinical guidelines are not well implemented, and alignment with international standards is minimal. Reimbursement and no-cost access are weak, resulting in high out-of-pocket costs. No national screening program exists; prostate cancer detection relies almost entirely on opportunistic PSA testing in urban hospitals. Overall, Ethiopia demonstrates a low maturity level (2) in prostate cancer care, with nascent foundations but wide gaps across the continuum.	{"Threats": ["Rising incidence and late presentation may overwhelm limited health system capacity.", "Economic constraints and high treatment costs perpetuate inequity.", "Dependence on external donors or private sector may hinder sustainable scale-up.", "Lack of structured awareness campaigns fuels stigma and delays diagnosis."], "Strengths": ["Centralized tertiary hospitals in Addis Ababa provide at least some access to oncology care.", "PSA testing available in select urban hospitals.", "Growing recognition of cancer as a national health priority."], "Weaknesses": ["Extremely limited specialized centers; rural populations have almost no access.", "Molecular biomarker testing capacity (BRCA1/2, PTEN, TMPRSS2-ERG) virtually absent.", "No organized screening program; detection depends on opportunistic PSA testing.", "Minimal palliative care availability, weak opioid access.", "Research funding and local clinical data are scarce.", "Clinical guidelines exist only on paper, with no consistent implementation.", "Very limited financial coverage, with most patients paying out of pocket."], "Opportunities": ["Expand cancer treatment centers beyond Addis Ababa to regional hubs.", "Introduce pilot programs for early detection in high-risk groups.", "Strengthen partnerships with international research institutions for biomarker access.", "Build capacity in oncology workforce through regional training initiatives.", "Improve integration of palliative care services into primary healthcare."]}	{"PSA": {"disc": "Limited use in urban hospitals.", "score": "~20%"}, "PTEN": {"disc": "Rare, research-only.", "score": "~5%"}, "BRCA1": {"disc": "Extremely limited.", "score": "~1%"}, "BRCA2": {"disc": "Extremely limited.", "score": "~1%"}, "TMPRSS2_ERG": {"disc": "Virtually absent.", "score": "~5%"}}	{"National_Screening": {"disc": "No program; opportunistic PSA only.", "score": "None"}}	{"Feasibility": {"disc": "Limited by resources.", "score": "1/5"}, "Implementation": {"disc": "Not consistently applied.", "score": "1/5"}, "ESMO_Guidelines": {"disc": "Not implemented.", "score": "1/5"}, "Engagement_with_Updates": {"disc": "Rarely updated.", "score": "1/3"}, "Adoption_International_Guideline": {"disc": "Minimal alignment.", "score": "1/5"}}	{"Specialized_Centers": {"disc": "Very limited; mainly Addis Ababa.", "score": "1/5"}, "Genetic_Molecular_Testing": {"disc": "Virtually no infrastructure for advanced biomarkers.", "score": "1/5"}}	{"No-cost_Access": {"disc": "Very few free/subsidized services.", "score": "1/5"}, "Reimbursement_Coverage": {"disc": "Almost no reimbursement; costs borne by patients.", "score": "1/5"}}	{"Survival_Rates": {"disc": "Outcomes are poor due to late diagnosis.", "score": "1/5"}, "Early_Detection": {"disc": "Opportunistic PSA testing only; no structured program.", "score": "1/5"}, "Palliative_Care": {"disc": "Very weak services, minimal integration.", "score": "1/5"}}	{"Research_Funding": {"disc": "Minimal funding, limited local studies.", "score": "1/5"}, "Treatment_Access": {"disc": "Highly centralized, weak rural access.", "score": "1/5"}, "Awareness_Campaigns": {"disc": "Very limited; public awareness remains low.", "score": "1/5"}}

16	prostate	India	IN	Prostate cancer is an increasingly common cancer among men in India, but structured early detection and equitable access to advanced care remain limited. Specialized cancer centers exist in major metropolitan cities and tertiary hospitals, yet rural and semi-urban populations face restricted access. Genetic and molecular diagnostic infrastructure is developing, with PSA testing relatively widespread but advanced biomarkers (TMPRSS2-ERG, PTEN, BRCA1/2) still limited, particularly outside academic and private centers. Standard treatment modalities (surgery, radiotherapy, androgen deprivation therapy) are available in tertiary hospitals, though capacity is uneven across regions. Research funding is modest but growing, with academic centers contributing to regional and genetic insights.

26	prostate	Nigeria	NG	Prostate cancer is the leading cancer among men in Nigeria, but detection and care remain severely limited due to weak infrastructure, inequitable access, and late-stage presentation. Specialized cancer centers are very few and concentrated in major cities such as Lagos, Abuja, and Ibadan, leaving rural and underserved areas without access to oncological services. Advanced diagnostics and biomarker testing (PSA, TMPRSS2-ERG, PTEN, BRCA1/2) are extremely limited, largely restricted to private laboratories or research settings, and remain unaffordable for most patients. Treatment services are inconsistent, with limited radiotherapy facilities and severe workforce shortages in oncology and urology. Clinical guidelines exist in draft or partial forms but are inconsistently implemented, with minimal alignment to international standards in lower-tier facilities. Reimbursement is virtually absent, with most patients paying out-of-pocket, leading to catastrophic financial burden. Screening is opportunistic, mainly through PSA testing in urban hospitals, with no national screening or early detection program. Overall, prostate cancer care in Nigeria reflects a low maturity level (1–2), with fragmented services, poor biomarker access, and very weak financial protection for patients.	{"Threats": ["Rising prostate cancer incidence and mortality due to delayed diagnosis.", "High treatment costs deepen inequities between private and public systems.", "Limited government health expenditure may restrict oncology investment.", "Workforce migration (brain drain) further weakens oncology services.", "Low awareness and cultural stigma delay health-seeking behavior."], "Strengths": ["Growing recognition of prostate cancer as a national health priority.", "Availability of PSA testing in select urban hospitals and private labs.", "A few specialized cancer centers in Lagos, Abuja, Ibadan.", "Emerging academic and research initiatives on cancer genetics and epidemiology."], "Weaknesses": ["Very limited specialized cancer centers relative to population size.", "Advanced biomarker utilization (TMPRSS2-ERG, PTEN, BRCA1/2) is nearly absent.", "Extremely limited radiotherapy capacity and trained oncology workforce.", "No national screening program; detection is opportunistic and urban-centered.", "Palliative care integration remains weak, with opioid access challenges.", "Over 70% of patients present with advanced or metastatic disease.", "Financial burden is high, with minimal reimbursement or no-cost access."], "Opportunities": ["Expansion of regional oncology centers to improve equitable access.", "Partnerships with international organizations for research and clinical trials.", "Scale-up of public awareness campaigns, particularly targeting men above 50.", "Advocacy for integrating prostate cancer screening into national health policy.", "Investment in molecular diagnostics through academic–private collaborations.", "Integration of telemedicine and mobile health to improve outreach."]}	{"PSA": {"disc": "Used in urban centers, but not widespread.", "score": "~30%"}, "PTEN": {"disc": "Very limited.", "score": "~5%"}, "BRCA1": {"disc": "Extremely rare access.", "score": "~5%"}, "BRCA2": {"disc": "Extremely rare access.", "score": "~5%"}, "TMPRSS2_ERG": {"disc": "Rarely available, mostly research.", "score": "~10%"}}	{"National_Screening": {"disc": "No national program; PSA used only opportunistically in some hospitals.", "score": "None"}}	{"Feasibility": {"disc": "Challenging in most facilities.", "score": "2/5"}, "Implementation": {"disc": "Partial, limited to larger hospitals.", "score": "2/5"}, "ESMO_Guidelines": {"disc": "Implemented, especially in advanced/metastatic care.Very low uptake.", "score": "1/5"}, "Engagement_with_Updates": {"disc": "Weak; smaller hospitals not engaged.", "score": "1/3"}, "Adoption_International_Guideline": {"disc": "Minimal alignment.", "score": "2/5"}}	{"Specialized_Centers": {"disc": "Very few centers, limited to major cities.", "score": "1/5"}, "Genetic_Molecular_Testing": {"disc": "Some infrastructure in private/research labs, but very limited access.", "score": "2/5"}}	{"No-cost_Access": {"disc": "Virtually absent.", "score": "1/5"}, "Reimbursement_Coverage": {"disc": "Almost no reimbursement under NHIS; patients self-fund care.", "score": "1/5"}}	{"Survival_Rates": {"disc": "Poor, due to late presentation and weak health system response.", "score": "1/5"}, "Early_Detection": {"disc": "Opportunistic PSA testing only; no organized program.", "score": "1/5"}, "Palliative_Care": {"disc": "Weak services; opioid access and integration remain limited.", "score": "1/5"}}	{"Research_Funding": {"disc": "Minimal; few local research projects.", "score": "1/5"}, "Treatment_Access": {"disc": "Severe inequities; radiotherapy and surgery access limited.", "score": "1/5"}, "Awareness_Campaigns": {"disc": "Scattered, low coverage, and not sustained nationally.", "score": "1/5"}}
27	prostate	Philippines	PH	Prostate cancer is an increasing health concern in the Philippines, with diagnosis often occurring at advanced stages due to limited systematic screening. Specialized cancer centers exist in major urban areas, but access for rural populations is constrained. Advanced molecular diagnostics are limited, primarily available in private hospitals or research settings. Clinical guidelines are available and partially implemented in tertiary centers, but smaller hospitals face challenges in keeping up with updates.

29	prostate	Russia	RU	Prostate cancer is among the most commonly diagnosed cancers in Russian men. Major urban centers have specialized cancer facilities and access to standard therapies, but rural and remote areas face limited availability of advanced diagnostics and oncology expertise. Molecular biomarker testing (PSA, TMPRSS2-ERG, PTEN, BRCA1/2) is available in select tertiary hospitals and private centers but is not widespread. National clinical guidelines exist and are implemented reasonably well in major hospitals, with partial alignment to international standards (ESMO/NCCN). Screening is largely opportunistic via PSA testing, with no fully implemented national population-based program. Reimbursement is partial, leaving some out-of-pocket costs for patients.

31	prostate	Saudi Arabia	SA	Prostate cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers among men in Saudi Arabia, though incidence remains lower compared to Western countries. Care infrastructure is relatively well-developed in major cities, supported by tertiary hospitals, national referral centers, and a growing private sector. Standard treatment options (surgery, radiotherapy, androgen deprivation therapy, chemotherapy) are widely available, and molecular testing capacity is expanding. However, access remains concentrated in urban centers such as Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dammam, with limited reach in rural and peripheral regions. There is no organized national screening program, and detection largely relies on opportunistic PSA testing, mostly in private or urban hospitals. Clinical guidelines exist, with moderate alignment to international standards such as ESMO and NCCN, and their implementation is fairly consistent in tertiary hospitals. Awareness efforts are improving, though stigma and low participation in screening persist. Financial barriers remain significant, with partial reimbursement for standard care but high out-of-pocket costs for advanced diagnostics and therapies. Overall, Saudi Arabia demonstrates intermediate maturity (level 3) in prostate cancer care, with progress in infrastructure, treatment access, and biomarker integration, but gaps in equitable distribution, reimbursement, and systematic screening.	{"Threats": ["Rising incidence with aging population may strain capacity.", "Continued urban–rural disparities in access.", "Financial sustainability challenges in adopting high-cost innovative therapies.", "Limited trained oncology workforce relative to growing patient demand."], "Strengths": ["Well-developed tertiary hospitals and oncology centers in major urban areas.", "Standard therapies widely available, including surgery, radiotherapy, ADT, and chemotherapy.", "Expanding infrastructure for genetic and molecular diagnostics (PSA, BRCA testing).", "Clinical guidelines in place with good uptake in tertiary settings.", "Active research and increasing regional participation in international collaborations."], "Weaknesses": ["Access concentrated in major cities; rural and smaller regions face limited availability.", "Opportunistic detection only; no structured national screening program.", "Biomarker utilization is still relatively low beyond PSA.", "Financial barriers remain, with reimbursement gaps for targeted therapies.", "Palliative care, while developing, is inconsistently available across the country."], "Opportunities": ["Expand systematic screening in high-risk groups.", "Strengthen molecular diagnostics and targeted therapy pathways (e.g., PARP inhibitors for BRCA mutations).", "Enhance national cancer registry and survival tracking.", "Expand palliative care networks and improve training for healthcare providers.", "Increase public awareness and education campaigns to reduce stigma."]}	{"PSA": {"disc": "Most widely used marker, though not part of systematic program.", "score": "55%"}, "PTEN": {"disc": "Available in select tertiary hospitals.", "score": "20%"}, "BRCA1": {"disc": "Growing availability; relevant for targeted therapy eligibility.", "score": "15%"}, "BRCA2": {"disc": "Similar to BRCA1; emerging but not widespread.", "score": "15%"}, "TMPRSS2_ERG": {"disc": "Limited availability, mainly in research/private hospitals.", "score": "25%"}}	{"National_Screening": {"disc": "Opportunistic PSA testing in urban/private hospitals; no organized population-level program.", "score": "--"}}	{"Feasibility": {"disc": "Feasible in well-equipped centers; regional hospitals less consistent.", "score": "4/5"}, "Implementation": {"disc": "National guidelines in place, well implemented in tertiary hospitals.", "score": "4/5"}, "ESMO_Guidelines": {"disc": "Integrated in many centers, especially for advanced disease.", "score": "4/5"}, "Engagement_with_Updates": {"disc": "Updates adopted by national centers; slower uptake in smaller hospitals.", "score": "2/3"}, "Adoption_International_Guideline": {"disc": "Largely aligned with NCCN/ESMO.", "score": "4/5"}}	{"Specialized_Centers": {"disc": "Well-established tertiary oncology centers in Riyadh, Jeddah, Dammam; rural access limited.", "score": "4/5"}, "Genetic_Molecular_Testing": {"disc": "Expanding infrastructure; PSA widely available; BRCA and PTEN testing emerging in select hospitals.", "score": "4/5"}}	{"No-cost_Access": {"disc": "Patients often face out-of-pocket payments for molecular testing and advanced treatment.", "score": "2/5"}, "Reimbursement_Coverage": {"disc": "Partial coverage under public insurance; gaps for advanced diagnostics and novel therapies.", "score": "2/5"}}	{"Survival_Rates": {"disc": "Survival improving due to earlier detection in urban centers and access to modern therapies.", "score": "4/5"}, "Early_Detection": {"disc": "Opportunistic PSA testing common in private/urban hospitals; no organized national program.", "score": "4/5"}, "Palliative_Care": {"disc": "Expanding services in major cities; national efforts ongoing to improve access and opioid regulation.", "score": "4/5"}}	{"Research_Funding": {"disc": "Active research programs and clinical trial participation; funding is growing.", "score": "4/5"}, "Treatment_Access": {"disc": "Comprehensive standard treatment widely accessible in tertiary hospitals; some inequities persist regionally.", "score": "4/5"}, "Awareness_Campaigns": {"disc": "Multiple campaigns supported by government and NGOs, though stigma remains a barrier.", "score": "4/5"}}
32	prostate	Serbia	RS	Prostate cancer is among the most commonly diagnosed cancers in men in Serbia. While specialized oncology centers exist in major cities, rural access remains limited. Treatment availability is uneven, with standard therapies concentrated in tertiary institutions. Molecular biomarker testing is emerging but not yet widely accessible, primarily confined to urban and research settings.

85	breast	Argentina	AR	Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women in Argentina, with a steadily increasing incidence. Urban areas, particularly Buenos Aires and other major cities, benefit from relatively advanced diagnostic facilities, including mammography and access to molecular testing for BRCA1/2. However, rural regions face challenges in early detection and treatment access, leading to disparities in outcomes. National clinical guidelines exist and are generally adopted in higher-tier hospitals but are unevenly implemented in smaller centers.

124	colorectal	Algeria	DZ	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is an emerging public health concern in Algeria, with incidence steadily increasing. Specialized centers exist but are limited in number and concentrated in major cities, leaving rural populations with reduced access. Molecular biomarker utilization (KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, MSI/dMMR, PIK3CA) is available at modest levels, mostly in tertiary hospitals, but overall coverage remains low compared to international standards. Clinical guidelines exist but are weakly implemented, with low integration of ESMO standards and limited engagement with updates. Treatment access is present but inconsistent, while research funding and awareness remain modest. Screening is opportunistic, with no formal national program, resulting in frequent late-stage diagnosis. Palliative care services exist but are insufficiently developed, particularly in rural areas.

126	colorectal	Australia	AU	Australia has a well-established healthcare system with strong infrastructure for colorectal cancer (CRC) care. Specialized cancer centers and advanced molecular testing are widely available, predominantly in urban and regional tertiary hospitals. Screening is organized nationally through the Bowel Cancer Screening Program (ages 50–74), supporting early detection. Clinical guidelines are well implemented and regularly updated, closely aligned with international standards (ESMO, NCCN). Research funding is moderate, supporting both clinical and molecular studies. Reimbursement for therapies and access to no-cost care is partially covered, with some out-of-pocket costs for advanced interventions.

130	colorectal	Colombia	CO	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is an emerging public health concern in Colombia, with incidence gradually increasing as life expectancy and lifestyle-related risk factors rise. While specialized oncology centers exist in major urban areas, rural and underserved regions face significant access barriers. Molecular biomarker testing (KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, MSI/dMMR, PIK3CA) is available but largely concentrated in tertiary and private centers. Treatment access is uneven, with strong disparities between public and private sectors. Clinical guidelines exist, partially aligned with international standards, and moderately implemented in well-equipped centers.

131	colorectal	Egypt	EG	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is an emerging public health concern in Egypt, with rising incidence due to lifestyle factors and increased longevity. Access to specialized oncology services exists in major urban centers such as Cairo and Alexandria, but rural areas face significant gaps in diagnostic and treatment access. Molecular testing (KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, MSI/dMMR, PIK3CA) is available in some tertiary and private centers, but not widely accessible across the country. Clinical guidelines are in place, with moderate adoption, though integration with ESMO recommendations is partial. Awareness and early detection remain weak, with no organized screening program; opportunistic screening is limited to urban clinics. Reimbursement systems provide partial support, but patients often face substantial out-of-pocket costs. Palliative care is underdeveloped, particularly outside metropolitan areas.

139	colorectal	Kenya	KE	Colorectal cancer is an emerging health concern in Kenya, with incidence steadily rising due to lifestyle changes, urbanization, and improved detection in urban hospitals. However, systematic detection and equitable access to care remain very limited. Specialized oncology centers are concentrated in Nairobi and select urban areas, while rural regions lack adequate infrastructure. Molecular biomarker testing (KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, MSI/dMMR, PIK3CA) is rarely available outside a few private and tertiary facilities. Treatment options are constrained by limited availability of surgical oncology expertise, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, particularly in public hospitals. Clinical guideline implementation is weak and only partially aligned with international standards, with major gaps in integration and regular updates. Screening is opportunistic and mostly limited to urban clinics, with no national screening program.

201	gastric	UAE	AE	Gastric cancer in the UAE is relatively rare compared to other cancers but presents challenges in early detection and access to advanced care. Specialized centers exist in major urban hubs, but rural and smaller city access remains limited. Diagnostic infrastructure, including endoscopy and molecular testing, is available mainly in tertiary/private hospitals. Standard treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy are accessible, though cost and insurance coverage can limit uptake. Awareness campaigns are moderate, with sporadic screening programs in private facilities but no organized national program. Clinical guidelines are partially implemented with alignment to international recommendations. Overall, gastric cancer care in the UAE shows moderate maturity, with strengths in treatment availability and guideline adherence, but gaps in systematic early detection, biomarker utilization, and equitable access.	{"Threats": ["Rising incidence of advanced-stage diagnosis due to lack of organized screening.", "High cost of targeted therapies may limit equitable access.", "Unequal distribution of specialized care between urban and rural areas.", "Workforce shortages in oncology and gastroenterology outside major centers."], "Strengths": ["Specialized cancer centers in major cities with access to advanced surgery, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy.", "Diagnostic infrastructure (endoscopy, imaging, molecular testing) available in tertiary hospitals.", "Clinical guidelines in place, partially aligned with international standards.", "Research activity emerging, particularly in molecular profiling."], "Weaknesses": ["Limited access to advanced diagnostics in smaller cities and rural areas.", "Biomarker testing (e.g., HER2, MSI, PD-L1) not universally available.", "No organized population-based screening; detection relies on opportunistic check-ups.", "Palliative care coverage is inconsistent, with rural access challenges.", "High out-of-pocket costs despite insurance coverage; limited no-cost access programs."], "Opportunities": ["Expand molecular diagnostics (HER2, MSI, PD-L1) to more centers for precision therapy.", "Develop national early detection initiatives, particularly for high-risk populations.", "Strengthen palliative care networks and training.", "Increase public awareness campaigns and community outreach.", "Encourage participation in international clinical trials."]}	{"HER2": {"disc": "Tested in most tertiary/private centers.", "score": "60%"}, "FGFR2b": {"disc": "Minimal availability, mainly in research settings.", "score": "25%"}, "CLDN18.2": {"disc": "Limited access in select centers.", "score": "30%"}, "MSI_H/dMMR": {"disc": "Moderate availability in specialized centers.", "score": "50%"}, "PDL_1_CPS>1": {"disc": "Testing available but not standardized.", "score": "50%"}}	{"National_Screening": {"disc": "No organized national screening; some private hospital programs exist.", "score": "Opportunistic only"}}	{"Feasibility": {"disc": "Practical in well-equipped hospitals; limited in smaller centers.", "score": "3/5"}, "Implementation": {"disc": "Guidelines partially implemented in tertiary hospitals.", "score": "3/5"}, "ESMO_Guidelines": {"disc": "Partially integrated, especially for advanced/metastatic care.", "score": "2/5"}, "Engagement_with_Updates": {"disc": "National centers adopt updates; smaller hospitals lag.", "score": "2/3"}, "Adoption_International_Guideline": {"disc": "Some alignment with ESMO/NCCN.", "score": "3/5"}}	{"Specialized_Centers": {"disc": "Specialized centers in major cities; limited rural access.", "score": "3/5"}, "Genetic_Molecular_Testing": {"disc": "Advanced biomarker testing available mainly in tertiary/private hospitals.", "score": "3/5"}}	{"No-cost_Access": {"disc": "Out-of-pocket costs remain high; limited subsidy programs.", "score": "2/5"}, "Reimbursement_Coverage": {"disc": "Insurance coverage exists but gaps remain for advanced therapies.", "score": "2/5"}}	{"Survival_Rates": {"disc": "Survival comparable to regional standards; late-stage diagnosis still occurs.", "score": "3/5"}, "Early_Detection": {"disc": "Opportunistic detection; no national screening program.", "score": "3/5"}, "Palliative_Care": {"disc": "Services available but unevenly distributed.", "score": "3/5"}}	{"Research_Funding": {"disc": "Moderate research activity in molecular profiling; local contributions emerging.", "score": "3/5"}, "Treatment_Access": {"disc": "Standard therapies available in tertiary hospitals; rural access limited.", "score": "3/5"}, "Awareness_Campaigns": {"disc": "Some awareness efforts; public knowledge remains moderate.", "score": "3/5"}}
202	gastric	Uganda	UG	Gastric cancer care in Uganda is at an early stage of development, with very limited infrastructure, diagnostics, and treatment options. Specialized cancer centers are concentrated in a few urban hospitals, leaving rural populations with minimal access. Molecular testing is largely unavailable outside research settings. Clinical guidelines exist but are poorly implemented, and reimbursement is minimal, resulting in high out-of-pocket costs. Screening is virtually nonexistent.

203	gastric	United Kingdom	GB	Gastric cancer in the United Kingdom is relatively uncommon compared to East Asia, but diagnosis often occurs at an advanced stage due to lack of population-level screening. Specialized cancer centers with multidisciplinary teams exist in major cities, and advanced diagnostics, including molecular profiling, are widely available in tertiary hospitals. Clinical guidelines are well established and closely aligned with international standards (ESMO/NCCN). Treatment access is generally equitable, though some geographic variability exists. Reimbursement and subsidized care are broadly available through the NHS. Early detection remains limited due to the absence of organized national screening programs. Overall, gastric cancer care in the UK shows high maturity, with strong infrastructure, treatment access, guideline implementation, and research integration.	{"Threats": ["Rising incidence of gastric cancer in certain ethnic groups.", "Budgetary constraints may limit adoption of new targeted therapies.", "Workforce shortages in gastroenterology and oncology."], "Strengths": ["Well-established specialized cancer centers with multidisciplinary teams.", "High availability of molecular diagnostics and targeted therapy testing.", "Strong alignment with international clinical guidelines (ESMO/NCCN).", "Broad public coverage through NHS, minimizing out-of-pocket costs.", "Active research programs and participation in international clinical trials."], "Weaknesses": ["No population-based gastric cancer screening program.", "Detection often occurs at an advanced stage.", "Geographic disparities in access to some specialized therapies."], "Opportunities": ["Develop pilot programs for targeted screening in high-risk populations.", "Expand public awareness campaigns on gastric cancer symptoms.", "Integrate emerging molecular biomarkers for personalized treatment."]}	{"HER2": {"disc": "Routine testing for targeted therapy eligibility.", "score": "90%"}, "FGFR2b": {"disc": "Limited to research and specialized centers.", "score": "55%"}, "CLDN18.2": {"disc": "Available in select centers for targeted therapy.", "score": "70%"}, "MSI_H/dMMR": {"disc": "Broadly implemented in tertiary centers.", "score": "85%"}, "PDL_1_CPS>1": {"disc": "Used for immunotherapy decision-making.", "score": "85%"}}	{"National_Screening": {"disc": "No organized national screening; not recommended for general population.", "score": "2/5"}}	{"Feasibility": {"disc": "Fully feasible across well-equipped hospitals.", "score": "5/5"}, "Implementation": {"disc": "Widely followed in NHS hospitals.", "score": "5/5"}, "ESMO_Guidelines": {"disc": "Fully integrated into clinical care.", "score": "5/5"}, "Engagement_with_Updates": {"disc": "National centers promptly adopt updates.", "score": "3/3"}, "Adoption_International_Guideline": {"disc": "Full alignment with ESMO/NCCN.", "score": "5/5"}}	{"Specialized_Centers": {"disc": "Specialized centers exist in major cities with multidisciplinary teams.", "score": "4/5"}, "Genetic_Molecular_Testing": {"disc": "Advanced molecular diagnostics widely available; strong infrastructure.", "score": "5/5"}}	{"No-cost_Access": {"disc": "Low out-of-pocket costs due to NHS.", "score": "3/5"}, "Reimbursement_Coverage": {"disc": "NHS provides coverage; private insurance optional.", "score": "3/5"}}	{"Survival_Rates": {"disc": "High survival relative to global benchmarks due to quality care.", "score": "5/5"}, "Early_Detection": {"disc": "Detection often late; no national screening program.", "score": "3/5"}, "Palliative_Care": {"disc": "Comprehensive palliative services widely accessible.", "score": "5/5"}}	{"Research_Funding": {"disc": "Active participation in clinical trials and research programs.", "score": "5/5"}, "Treatment_Access": {"disc": "Standard and advanced therapies accessible across NHS hospitals.", "score": "5/5"}, "Awareness_Campaigns": {"disc": "Campaigns exist but general population awareness remains moderate.", "score": "4/5"}}
205	gastric	Vietnam	VN	Gastric cancer remains a significant health burden in Vietnam, with high incidence in urban and rural populations. Access to specialized care is concentrated in major cities, while rural areas face limited diagnostics and treatment availability. Molecular testing for targeted therapy is emerging but still restricted to select centers. Clinical guidelines exist but are variably implemented, and public awareness remains low.

204	gastric	United States	US	Gastric cancer in the United States is relatively uncommon compared to East Asia but carries high mortality when diagnosed late. Specialized centers and tertiary hospitals provide advanced care, with access to endoscopy, surgery, systemic therapies, and targeted treatments. Screening is not population-based; it is limited to high-risk groups (e.g., familial syndromes, immigrants from high-incidence countries). Molecular profiling and biomarker-guided therapies are increasingly integrated in clinical practice. Clinical guidelines (NCCN, ASCO) are widely implemented in academic and tertiary centers. Reimbursement exists for most standard therapies, though access to novel or high-cost therapies may involve out-of-pocket expenses.
